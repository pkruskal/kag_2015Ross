- A lot of this is going to be fitting the noise in the predicted periods via multiple submissions so need to start sending test cases ASAP to explore this. 
o Maybe some kinda rev cor to model the noise or something similar to weinerkernal analysis

- Baseline will depend on day of week, general trends, promotional periods, should be able to make a quick model for this
o For each store test day of week (DOW) effects (consider additive, or multiplicative model) 
o For each store subtract DOW effects from an additive or multiplicative model. Then look for seasonal trends
o On week and season rectified data. 
* Mean subtract data by subtracting out a smoothed version of the data. 
* Then run a simple regression tree analysis based on promotional, holiday and store prams, (with an additional term for the sliding mean of the data)
o For prediction periods
* Start with mean sales extrapolation based on smooth trending
* Add DOW
* Add regression tree variance
- Taking other effects into account
o How do variables effect customer sales correlation
