- run grid search on simple models
	- for now run this raw saving results for further analysis and questions

- things to alter
	- consider all stores for estimating a single store using a simple bool column as a store indicator
	- consider all stores for estimating a single store using store id as the only store indicator
	- add promo 2 for single months of intervals
	- add promo 2 as different promos for different intervals (a,b,c,d etc)
	- add a season flag (1-12 so as months really but use March as month 1)
	- change the subsample to allow for stocastic fitting
	- change max_features to change the search of features to split on
	- play with max_leaf_nodes, and maybe increase depth as a trade off
		- maybe would want this if structure is more hierarchical? probably not for this problem, but maybe NBA



- things to look for
	- look at time effects after subtracting current fits
		- make this as a plotting function
	- replot with promo 2 concepts
		- maybe time depenent

- A lot of this is going to be fitting the noise in the predicted periods via multiple submissions so need to start sending test cases ASAP to explore this. 
o Maybe some kinda rev cor to model the noise or something similar to weinerkernal analysis

- Baseline will depend on day of week, general trends, promotional periods, should be able to make a quick model for this
o For each store test day of week (DOW) effects (consider additive, or multiplicative model) 
o For each store subtract DOW effects from an additive or multiplicative model. Then look for seasonal trends
o On week and season rectified data. 
* Mean subtract data by subtracting out a smoothed version of the data. 
* Then run a simple regression tree analysis based on promotional, holiday and store prams, (with an additional term for the sliding mean of the data)
o For prediction periods
* Start with mean sales extrapolation based on smooth trending
* Add DOW
* Add regression tree variance
- Taking other effects into account
o How do variables effect customer sales correlation
